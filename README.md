work in progress - adapting the yolov5 v6.0 to work for multi channel inputs :)
This code lays the ground for my master's thesis - i will be exploring whether adding additional channels to images that are sent to a neural network results in an increase in object detection performance


This project began during my 1year tenure as a researcher at the image processing group on FER, Zagreb, All interested contributors are welcome
