[i talk about this more on my website](https://jere357.github.io/rgbd.html)


work in progress - adapting the yolov5 v6.0 to work for multi channel inputs :)
 I am interested in experimenting with a novel approach to object detection. (I have been unsuccesful in finding related work regarding this theme). Rather than relying solely on RGB images, I aim to enhance the input data by adding extra channel features. By doing so, I hope to create a more nuanced and detailed representation of the images, which can potentially lead to exciting advances in computer vision research. (I may be wrong idk)



This project began during my 1year tenure as a researcher at the image processing group on FER, Zagreb, All interested contributors are welcome

\#TODO: write a better readme.md
\#TODO: augmentations
\#TODO: average mixed precision
\#TODO: let's say your first layer has 32 filters and you want 22 on the RGB channels and 10 filters on the Depth channel or some stuff like that
